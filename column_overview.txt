The prioritization was adopted as follows: gri = Kp was calculated from gri magnitudes using Equations (2)-(5) in Brown+ (2011, J/AJ/142/112). BV =	Sloan gr was estimated from Johnson BV using the transformations by Bilir+ (2005, J/AN/326/321): Equation (1): g-r=1.124(B-V)-0.252 and Equation (2): g=V+0.634(B-V)-0.108 Kp was then calculated from gr using Equation (2) in Brown+ (2011, J/AJ/142/112).  JHK = Kp was calculated using the polynomial J-K relations by Howell+ (2012ApJ...746..123H). Given x=J-K these transformations are: Equation (3): Kp=0.42443603+3.7937617x-2.3267277x2 +1.4602553x3+K, for all stars with J-H>0.75 and H-K>0.1 (approximate color cut for giants), and Equation (4): Kp=0.314377+3.85667x+3.176111x2 -25.3126x3+40.7221x4 -19.2112x5+K, for all remaining stars. The above relations are applied for -0.2<J-K<1.2 for giants and -0.2<J-K<1.0 for dwarfs, which are the calibration ranges given by Howell+ (2012ApJ...746..123H). J = For sources outside the color limits of Equations (3) and (4) or sources which only have a valid J-band magnitude, a rough estimate of Kp was calculated from the J-band magnitude using the relations by Howell+ (2012ApJ...746..123H): Equation (5):-398.04666+149.08127J-21.952130J2 +1.5968619J3-0.057478947J4 +0.00082033223J5+J for J=10-16.7 and Equation (6): Kp=0.1918+1.08156J for J>16.7.

It measures the disagreement, expressed as an angle, between the observations of a source and the best-fitting standard astrometric model (using five astrometric parameters). The assumed observational noise in each observation is quadratically increased by the excess noise in order to statistically match the residuals in the astrometric solution. A value of 0 signifies that the source is astrometrically well-behaved, i.e. that the residuals of the fit statistically agree with the assumed observational noise. A positive value signifies that the residuals are statistically larger than expected. The significance of the excess noise is given by ASTROMETRIC\_EXCESS\_NOISE\_SIG\_GAIA. If this value is less than or equal to 2, the excess noise is probably not significant, and the source may be astrometrically well-behaved even ifthe excess noise is large. The excess noise may absorb all kinds of modelling errors that are not accounted for by the observational noise (image centroiding error) or the excess attitude noise. Such modelling errors include LSF and PSF calibration errors, geometric instrument calibration errors, and part of the high-frequency attitude noise. These modelling errors are particularly important in the early data releases, but should decrease as the astrometric modelling of the instrument and attitude improves over the years. Additionally, sources that deviate from the standard five-parameter astrometric model (e.g. unresolved binaries, exoplanet systems, etc.) may have positive ϵiϵi. Given the many other possible contributions to the excess noise, the user must study the empirical distributions of this and ASTROMETRIC\_EXCESS\_NOISE\_SIG\_GAIA to make sensible cutoffs before filtering out sources for their particular application. The excess source noise is further explained in Sects. 3.6 and 5.1.2 of Lindegren et al. (2012). ",0,0

Consequently, this is expected to be greater than 2 for only a few percent of the sources with well-behaved astrometric solutions. In the early data releases the excess noise will however include instrument and attitude modelling errors that are statistically significant and could result in large values. The user must study the empirical distributions of these statistics and make sensible cutoffs before filtering out sources for their particular application.

A small value (e.g. less than 10) indicates that the calculated parallax could be more vulnerable to errors, e.g. from the calibration model, not reflected in the formal uncertainties.

The matrix is scaled so as to put the five parameters on a comparable scale, taking into account the maximum along-scan parallax factor for the parallax and the time coverage of the observations for the proper motion components. This is given for both 5-parameter and 2-parameter solutions, as its size is one of the criteria for accepting or rejecting the 5-parameter solution.

This measures the excess of flux in the BP and RP integrated photometry with respect to the G band. This excess is believed to be caused by background and contamination issues affecting the BP and RP data. Therefore a large value of this factor for a given source indicates systematic errors in the BP and RP photometry.  For more details see Riello et al. (2018). ,0,0
PHOT_PROC_MODE_GAIA,phot_proc_mode_GAIA,FLAG,"Photometry processing mode in Gaia DR2. This flag indicates different calibration procedures in place. The following possible values are defined for Gaia DR2: '0': Gold photometric dataset. Sources in this dataset have been used to establish the internal photometric system and to compute all calibrations. '1' = Silver photometric dataset. Sources in this dataset have no reference photometry. The processing of these sources is an iterative process, where calibrations computed using the ”gold” dataset are applied initially to raw fluxes and at each iteration a new set of reference photometry is obtained from the accumulation of all calibrated epoch photometry. '3' = Bronze photometric dataset. Sources in this dataset lack complete colour information in the Gaia data. A default colour is therefore used to apply the calibrations computed using the ”gold” dataset. For Gaia DR2 it is expected that all sources that were calibrated using a default colour will have only G band photometry available (no integrated BP or RP).",0,0

The sky group is an integer that groups stars together on the sky depending on which channel they fall on (or near) during season 2. Due to slight asymmetries in the CCD array layout, positions are not perfectly maintained upon seasonal rotation of the spacecraft. Therefore, there are objects that fall off silicon during season 2 but are on silicon in subsequent seasons. This is especially problematic for Module 13 due to the center gap. Such stars are assigned the sky group corresponding to the other stars that fall on the same channel during other seasons. (KIC targets only)",0,0

The sky group is an integer that groups stars together on the sky depending on which channel they fall on (or near) during season 2. Due to slight asymmetries in the CCD array layout, positions are not perfectly maintained upon seasonal rotation of the spacecraft. Therefore, there are objects that fall off silicon during season 2 but are on silicon in subsequent seasons. This is especially problematic for Module 13 due to the center gap. Such stars are assigned the sky group corresponding to the other stars that fall on the same channel during other seasons. (KIC targets only)",0,0
